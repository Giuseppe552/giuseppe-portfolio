# giuseppegiona.com 🌐

This repository contains the source code for my personal website and blog: [giuseppegiona.com](https://giuseppegiona.com).  
It’s my space to share projects, write about software development, and document what I’m learning along the way.

## 🔒 Security & Reliability

I’ve set this project up with **production-grade practices**, even as a personal site:

- Enforced **security headers** (CSP, HSTS, Referrer Policy, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options).  
- Continuous Integration (CI) with:
  - **ESLint + TypeScript checks** (0 warnings)  
  - **Dependency audit** (npm + depcheck)  
  - **ZAP Baseline security scans**  
- Branch protection rules on `main` (all PRs must pass checks before merge).  
- Automatic Vercel deployments with preview environments for every PR.
