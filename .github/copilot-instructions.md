   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Linting and Type Checking

Run ESLint and TypeScript checks:
```bash

- **Dynamic Routing**: Uses Next.js dynamic routes (e.g., `[slug]` for blog posts).
- **TailwindCSS**: Follow the utility-first CSS approach.
- **GitHub API Integration**: Utilities in `lib/github.ts` interact with GitHub repositories.

---

## üåê Deployment

- **Vercel**: Automatic deployments for `main` and preview deployments for pull requests.

---

## üîó External Dependencies

- **Framer Motion**: Used for animations.
- **GitHub API**: Fetches repository data for portfolio projects.

## üß† Tips for AI Agents

- **Understand the Architecture**: Familiarize yourself with the `src/app/` structure and dynamic routing in Next.js.
- **Follow TailwindCSS Patterns**: Use existing utility classes and avoid inline styles.
- **Respect Security Practices**: Ensure changes do not compromise security headers or CI checks.
- **Leverage Reusable Components**: Check `components/` for existing UI elements before creating new ones.
