## Key takeaways

- 73% of hiring managers prefer portfolios over certifications for entry-level roles
- Side projects demonstrate real problem-solving abilities under constraints
- Building projects develops skills that certifications cannot teach
- GitHub portfolios receive 5x more recruiter attention than certificate lists
- Personal projects show initiative and passion for technology
- Practical experience translates directly to job performance

While certifications validate knowledge, side projects prove you can build solutions. Smart career strategy combines both, but prioritizes hands-on development experience.

## FAQ

**Q: Should I focus on certifications or side projects?**
A: Prioritize side projects first, then add relevant certifications. Projects demonstrate practical skills that directly translate to job performance.

**Q: What makes a good portfolio project?**
A: Choose projects that solve real problems, use technologies relevant to your target job, and include clear documentation with live demos.

## Finding the Balance

That‚Äôs not to say certifications aren‚Äôt useful ‚Äî they can help with credibility in certain areas like cloud, security, or databases. But if you‚Äôre trying to get your first dev role, a portfolio of small but working projects is often the thing that sets you apart.

## Takeaway

If you‚Äôre deciding whether to spend the weekend chasing another certificate or building a small app, I‚Äôd say go for the app. Even a basic project shows initiative, helps you learn faster, and gives recruiters something real to look at.

üëâ Side projects aren‚Äôt just practice ‚Äî they‚Äôre your way of proving you‚Äôre ready.



## Common Questions: Certifications vs. Side Projects

1. Do certifications help you get a job in tech?
Yes ‚Äî especially in cloud, security, or niche areas. But for entry-level dev roles, projects often carry more weight because they show applied skills.

2. Can side projects replace certifications?
For many junior roles, yes. A portfolio with real projects demonstrates problem-solving better than certificates alone.

3. What‚Äôs the best balance?
1‚Äì2 relevant certifications + a GitHub portfolio of practical projects is an ideal mix.

4. Do recruiters actually check GitHub?
Yes. A clear, active GitHub with documentation often gets more attention than a long list of certificates.

5. Which projects should beginners build?
Start small: budget tracker, resume parser, dashboard, or automation script. They‚Äôre simple but impactful.
