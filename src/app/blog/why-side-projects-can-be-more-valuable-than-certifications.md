When you’re trying to break into tech, it’s easy to feel pressure to collect certifications. They look official, they come with logos from big companies, and they give you something to put on your CV.

But I’ve learned that side projects often carry more weight — especially when you’re looking for your first role. Projects show that you can actually apply your skills in the real world, not just pass a test.

## What Side Projects Show

A certification says you understand the theory. A project shows you can take an idea, build it out, and solve problems along the way. Even something simple like a resume parser, a budgeting tool, or a personal website is proof that you can turn knowledge into something practical.

## Learning by Doing

I’ve found that projects teach me far more than courses ever do. Tutorials are great for structure, but projects force you to deal with the unexpected — bugs, edge cases, weird data, user experience. That’s where the real growth happens.

## Making a Portfolio That Stands Out

When recruiters or hiring managers see a GitHub profile with working projects, screenshots, and clear documentation, it speaks louder than another certificate line on a CV. Even small projects show initiative, creativity, and the ability to deliver something useful.

## Certifications vs. Side Projects

Here’s how they compare from the perspective of someone still breaking into the industry:

|  Criteria                   | Certifications (Pros & Cons)               | Side Projects (Pros & Cons)                   |
|---------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Proof of knowledge**      | ✅ Yes (theory + exam)      | ✅ Yes (hands-on application)    |
| **Shows problem-solving**   | ❌ Limited                  | ✅ Strong evidence                   |
| **Cost**                   | 💰 Expensive                | 🪴 Usually free or low-cost             |
| **Portfolio value**        | 🤏 Line on CV               | 🌟 Tangible proof on GitHub/website |
| **Learning depth**         | 📚 Structured but predictable  | 🛠️ Practical, messy, deeper     |

## Finding the Balance

That’s not to say certifications aren’t useful — they can help with credibility in certain areas like cloud, security, or databases. But if you’re trying to get your first dev role, a portfolio of small but working projects is often the thing that sets you apart.

## Takeaway

If you’re deciding whether to spend the weekend chasing another certificate or building a small app, I’d say go for the app. Even a basic project shows initiative, helps you learn faster, and gives recruiters something real to look at.

👉 Side projects aren’t just practice — they’re your way of proving you’re ready.



## Common Questions: Certifications vs. Side Projects

1. Do certifications help you get a job in tech?
Yes — especially in cloud, security, or niche areas. But for entry-level dev roles, projects often carry more weight because they show applied skills.

2. Can side projects replace certifications?
For many junior roles, yes. A portfolio with real projects demonstrates problem-solving better than certificates alone.

3. What’s the best balance?
1–2 relevant certifications + a GitHub portfolio of practical projects is an ideal mix.

4. Do recruiters actually check GitHub?
Yes. A clear, active GitHub with documentation often gets more attention than a long list of certificates.

5. Which projects should beginners build?
Start small: budget tracker, resume parser, dashboard, or automation script. They’re simple but impactful.
